  		<h1>Hi - I'm Chloe's magic learning to code website</h1>
  	</div>
  	<h2>Site Structure</h2>
  	<p>You can see how I have structured my directory in this github repo</p>
  	<h2>Deployment</h2>
  		
  	<p>To help us get our site live we will be using <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge.sh</a>
  			Surge is a static web publishing tool that makes deploying websites quick and easy. There are limitations but it is fine for our purposes.
  			Surge has an excellent video that explains how to deploy from the command line. I recommend you watch it</p>

			<h2>INSTRUCTIONS </h2> 
			<ol> <li>ensure you have a recent version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a></li>
			<li>Then from the comannd line install Surge using npm by running the following command:
`npm install --global surge`. You may need to preface this command with sudo</li>
			<li>If you make an edit to your site and want to redeploy `surge --domain chloedonegan.surge.sh`</li>
			<li>Wouldn't it be nicer just to be able to type `surge`? Save your domain name to a cname file - in the command line 'echo chloedonegan.surge.sh > CNAME'</li>
			<li>Make a change , then type surge into your comand line and check out your site again!</li>
